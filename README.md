- We created a social media site based around music. It is meant to be a site where students can talk about music related topics whether it be songs, artist, instruments, or genres. Some of the included features on our site include online & offline instant-messaging/DM, posting to the site, commenting on posts, admin power to block posts/comments and create accounts, profile search, Spotify API integration, and vimeo/youtube/soundcloud integration. We coded this website in its entirety and used Amazon Web Services to host the site and used DynamoDB for our database. We all helped each other complete various parts of the website we were not just limited to our specific roles.
